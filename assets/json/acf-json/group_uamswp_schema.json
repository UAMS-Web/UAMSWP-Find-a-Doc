				"AnatomicalStructure": "<strong>AnatomicalStructure</strong> &mdash; Any part of the human body, typically a component of an anatomical system. Organs, tissues, and cells are all anatomical structures.",
				"AnatomicalSystem": "<strong>AnatomicalSystem</strong> &mdash; An anatomical system is a group of anatomical structures that work together to perform a certain task. Anatomical systems, such as organ systems, are one organizing principle of anatomy, and can include circulatory, digestive, endocrine, integumentary, immune, lymphatic, muscular, nervous, reproductive, respiratory, skeletal, urinary, vestibular, and other systems.",
				"DrugClass": "<strong>DrugClass</strong> &mdash; A class of medical drugs, e.g., statins. Classes can represent general pharmacological class, common mechanisms of action, common physiological effects, etc.",
				"DrugCost": "<strong>DrugCost</strong> &mdash; The cost per unit of a medical drug. Note that this type is not meant to represent the price in an offer of a drug for sale; see the Offer type for that. This type will typically be used to tag wholesale or average retail cost of a drug, or maximum reimbursable cost. Costs of medical drugs vary widely depending on how and where they are paid for, so while this type captures some of the variables, costs should be used with caution by consumers of this schema's markup.",
				"LifestyleModification": "<strong>LifestyleModification</strong> &mdash; A process of care involving exercise, changes to diet, fitness routines, and other lifestyle changes aimed at improving a health condition.",
				"MedicalCause": "<strong>MedicalCause</strong> &mdash; The causative agent(s) that are responsible for the pathophysiologic process that eventually results in a medical condition, symptom or sign. In this schema, unless otherwise specified this is meant to be the proximate cause of the medical condition, symptom or sign. The proximate cause is defined as the causative agent that most directly results in the medical condition, symptom or sign. For example, the HIV virus could be considered a cause of AIDS. Or in a diagnostic context, if a patient fell and sustained a hip fracture and two days later sustained a pulmonary embolism which eventuated in a cardiac arrest, the cause of the cardiac arrest (the proximate cause) would be the pulmonary embolism and not the fall. Medical causes can include cardiovascular, chemical, dermatologic, endocrine, environmental, gastroenterologic, genetic, hematologic, gynecologic, iatrogenic, infectious, musculoskeletal, neurologic, nutritional, obstetric, oncologic, otolaryngologic, pharmacologic, psychiatric, pulmonary, renal, rheumatologic, toxic, traumatic, or urologic causes; medical conditions can be causes as well.",
				"MedicalCondition": "<strong>MedicalCondition</strong> &mdash; Any condition of the human body that affects the normal functioning of a person, whether physically or mentally. Includes diseases, injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, etc.",
				"MedicalContraindication": "<strong>MedicalContraindication</strong> &mdash; A condition or factor that serves as a reason to withhold a certain medical therapy. Contraindications can be absolute (there are no reasonable circumstances for undertaking a course of action) or relative (the patient is at higher risk of complications, but these risks may be outweighed by other considerations or mitigated by other measures).",
				"MedicalDevice": "<strong>MedicalDevice</strong> &mdash; Any object used in a medical capacity, such as to diagnose or treat a patient.",
				"MedicalGuideline": "<strong>MedicalGuideline</strong> &mdash; Any recommendation made by a standard society (e.g. ACC/AHA) or consensus statement that denotes how to diagnose and treat a particular condition. Note: this type should be used to tag the actual guideline recommendation; if the guideline recommendation occurs in a larger scholarly article, use MedicalScholarlyArticle to tag the overall article, not this type. Note also: the organization making the recommendation should be captured in the recognizingAuthority base property of MedicalEntity.",
				"MedicalIndication": "<strong>MedicalIndication</strong> &mdash; A condition or factor that indicates use of a medical therapy, including signs, symptoms, risk factors, anatomical states, etc.",
				"MedicalIntangible": "<strong>MedicalIntangible</strong> &mdash; A utility class that serves as the umbrella for a number of 'intangible' things in the medical space.",
				"MedicalProcedure": "<strong>MedicalProcedure</strong> &mdash; A medical procedure is a process of care used in either a diagnostic, therapeutic, preventive or palliative capacity that relies on invasive (surgical), non-invasive, or other techniques.",
				"MedicalRiskEstimator": "<strong>MedicalRiskEstimator</strong> &mdash; Any rule set or interactive tool for estimating the risk of developing a complication or condition.",
				"MedicalRiskFactor": "<strong>MedicalRiskFactor</strong> &mdash; A risk factor is anything that increases a person's likelihood of developing or contracting a disease, medical condition, or complication.",
				"MedicalStudy": "<strong>MedicalStudy</strong> &mdash; A medical study is an umbrella type covering all kinds of research studies relating to human medicine or health, including observational studies and interventional trials and registries, randomized, controlled or not. When the specific type of study is known, use one of the extensions of this type, such as MedicalTrial or MedicalObservationalStudy. Also, note that this type should be used to mark up data that describes the study itself; to tag an article that publishes the results of a study, use MedicalScholarlyArticle. Note: use the code property of MedicalEntity to store study IDs, e.g. clinicaltrials.gov ID.",
				"MedicalTest": "<strong>MedicalTest</strong> &mdash; Any medical test, typically performed for diagnostic purposes.",
				"Substance": "<strong>Substance</strong> &mdash; Any matter of defined composition that has discrete existence, whose origin may be biological, mineral or chemical.",
				"SuperficialAnatomy": "<strong>SuperficialAnatomy</strong> &mdash; Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure)."

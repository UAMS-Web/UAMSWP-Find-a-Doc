# Agent instructions for UAMSWP-Find-a-Doc

This file is the single source of agent instructions for this repository. Claude Code, Cursor and Codex all read it directly; there is no `CLAUDE.md`, because Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` only when `CLAUDE.md` is absent. Put instructions here, never in a `CLAUDE.md`.

Everything above the generated section below belongs to this repository and is edited here. The generated section is rewritten by the sync from `UAMS-Web/uams-claude-skills`; edit the shared skills and rules there.

## About this repository

Replace this section with what an agent needs to know before working here: what the repository is, how to install and run it, how to run its tests and checks, the conventions it follows, and anything that is true of this repository alone. The shared skills and rules below cover the organization-wide conventions; do not repeat them here.

## Shared skills and rules

The files listed here are synced from [UAMS-Web/uams-claude-skills](https://github.com/UAMS-Web/uams-claude-skills) (`shared/`) and are edited there, never here; a sync pull request brings changes into this repository. This section is generated; everything outside it belongs to this repository.

Each rule below is a standing instruction for every task in this repository. Its full text is delivered three times: `.claude/rules/<name>.md`, which Claude Code loads in every session; `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc`, which Cursor always applies; and the skill `.agents/skills/rule-<name>/`, which Codex selects by its description. Before work a rule governs, read its full text. Skills are in `.claude/skills/` and, as the same files, in `.agents/skills/`, and load when their description matches the task.
